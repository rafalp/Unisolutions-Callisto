# Unisolutions-Callisto

Callisto was my first forum software that I've writen in PHP back in 2006-ish p'much with one eye to IPB 2.3 and another to vBulletin 3. It was great adventure

Uploaded for nostalgia reasons. Comes with zero support, only polish language and is unlikely to run with today PHP, and even if it did, I've had no idea what DB indexes or keys are query execution plans are back then, so expect performance to be brutal.
